Title: Microchipping & Registration Intro

----

Text: 

## MICROCHIPPING
A microchip is a ‘subcutaneous full duplex electronic radio transponder’. That means it sits just below the animals skin and the information it holds can be read by a scanner. Microchips are about the size of a grain of rice and are implanted between the animal’s shoulders at the back of the neck. No personal information is stored on the microchip, only the unique identification number.

In NSW all cats and dogs, other than exempt cats and dogs, must be microchipped by 12 weeks of age or before being sold or given away (whichever happens first).

## REGISTRATION
All cats and dogs, other than exempt cats and dogs, must be registered by 6 months of age. The registration fee is a once-only payment, which covers the cat or dog for its lifetime in NSW, regardless of any changes in ownership. 

We recommend you have your cat or dog desexed before registering it as discounted registration fees apply to desexed cats and dogs. Having your cat or dog desexed helps to reduce straying, fighting and aggressive and antisocial behaviour, such as spraying to mark territory. It also helps to reduce the number of unwanted pets born each year.

Councils use registration fees to provide animal management services for the community. This includes ranger services, dog refuse bins, educational and other companion animal-related activities.
