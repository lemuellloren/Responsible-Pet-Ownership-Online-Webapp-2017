## What Is Nuisance Barking?
Nuisance barking may be described as barking which *persistently* occurs or continues to such a degree or extent that it unreasonably *interferes with the peace, comfort or convenience* of any person in any premises.

## Is My Dog Barking Too Much?
You may not realise your dog is barking excessively, especially if you are away from home at the time. A neighbour may approach you regarding the noise your dog is exhibiting and the first step is to remain calm and try to see things from their point of view.  Ask your neighbour exactly when the dog is barking and the duration. Think about setting up a web cam or video camera at these times to help determine what your dog is doing when you are not home. Alternatively you could try a ‘set -up” by pretending you are leaving for the day, and then wait outside the door to see if your dog starts barking.

If you can work out the reasons why your dog is barking, it will then be easier to find a way to stop the problem.
