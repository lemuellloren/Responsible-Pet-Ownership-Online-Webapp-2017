## Why Do Dogs Bark?
Barking is a natural way dogs vocalise to communicate their feelings. Barking may signal a warning, danger, play, excitement, panic, fear etc. It is normal for all dogs to bark and responsible dog owners need to ensure barking is kept to a minimum and the dog is barking only at appropriate times.

## Causes of Problems for Barking Dogs
 - Boredom / Lonely Dog –Dogs left on their own for extended periods of time. 
 - Kept on a chain or in a place too small for the dog's needs – confinement to a small space can increase anxiety, causing the dog to bark more often
 - Unsuitable environment for the breed –  Lack of environmental enrichment toys, sand pit, bones to chew, games  or an active breed of dog in a small yard 
 - Lack of exercise – Not taken on regular walks or doggie activities such as obedience, agility or flyball, etc.  
 - Provoked deliberately or unintentionally by people or roaming dogs – Passers-by, people and  dogs walking past gates and fence lines
 - Separation Anxiety –  dogs may suffer terrible anxiety and distress when their owner is not home 
 - Untrained –  Little or no behaviour modification training invested into the dog 
 - Sick - The dog could be ill.  This may be a result of blindness, hearing loss, kennel cough etc.
 - Hungry/ Thirsty – A dog may bark to alert the owner of their basic needs (i.e food/water).  
 - Victims of abuse – Abused/Neglected ill-treated dogs - If you suspect an animal is being abused contact the (link: https://www.rspcansw.org.au/ text: RSPCA popup: yes) or (link: http://www.awlnsw.com.au text: Animal Welfare League popup: yes) Inspectors.
