Title: Desexing FAQs

## What age should I desex my pet?
Pets can be de-sexed from as young as eight weeks although your vet may advise you to wait until 3-5 months or a little longer depending on size, age and general health of your pet at the time.   
Most pets should be desexed by six months of age. It is important to remember that cats are capable of falling pregnant from as young as 20 weeks of age (5 months).

## Shouldn’t we let our female have at least one litter?
There is no good reason to let your female dog or cat have a litter. Many stray and unwanted animals born under similar circumstances end up in pounds and shelters every year and are euthanised. Allowing your pet to breed only contributes to this community problem.

## My pet is a male he can’t fall pregnant, why bother?
The majority of dog bites are caused by male dogs who are not desexed. There are serious penalties for your dog being involved in such attacks. Section 16 of the Companion Animals Act, 1998 (The Act) defines a dog attack as; “If a dog rushes at, attacks, bites, harasses or chases any person or animal (other than vermin), whether or not any injury is caused to the person or animal.” 

Section 27 of the Act states that; 
> “the owner (or person in charge) of an attacking dog is liable for damages in respect of bodily injury to a person, damage to property of a person (including clothing) and/or veterinary bills in respect to injury (whether or not fatal) to another animal caused by a dog attacking or chasing it. “

Male animals are more inclined to roam and fight if they are not desexed. They can meet many females on their travels and can father many litters in one evening – contributing to the problem of stray and unwanted animals in the pounds and shelters. Desexed male animals make better companions, as they are generally a more affectionate and loving pet.

## Will my pet become overweight?
With the right amount of exercise and correct diet your pet shouldn’t become overweight. Dogs like people, only become overweight if they eat too much and exercise too little.

## Will my pet’s personality/behaviour change if I desex?
The female’s personality really shouldn’t change at all.  In the males most personalities will change for the better, often a less aggressive, calmer, relaxed and happy pet. The males will usually become a more loving and enjoyable companions.
